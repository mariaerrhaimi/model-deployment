Tikok subscribers predictor:
Ever wonder how Tiktok got us so hooked to mindless scrolling and never getting enough of it.well today is your unlucky day cause in my project i am gonna be doing something totally diffrent and not answering that question.
in this project i will be building a model that predict the number of subscribers based on features like(Hashtag_1,playCount, authorMeta_video, creator_likes)
in order to do this i have used a scraper called tiktok scraper that you can find in in apify: https://apify.com/
next i am gonna do some data cleaning removing all the unecessary columns and Nan values
next i am going to do some visualization with the help of seaborn and scatter plots 
next we are gonna start building our model that will have as target number of subscribers and as features :(Hashtag_1,playCount, authorMeta_video, creator_likes)
